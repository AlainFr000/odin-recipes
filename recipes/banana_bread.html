        </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>5 small ripe spotted bananas, divided (about 4 1/2 ounces each)</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
        <li>1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon packed dark brown sugar, divided</li>
        <li>2 cups self rising flour</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a 9- x 5-inch loaf pan with parchment paper, leaving a 2-inch overhang on all sides; set aside. </li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Mash 4 of the bananas in a large bowl using a fork until mostly smooth to equal 1 1/2 cups. Add eggs and 1/2 cup brown sugar; stir until combined.</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Add flour to the banana mixture; stir until just combined and no dry streaks remain, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed.</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Pour batter into the prepared loaf pan and spread into an even layer.</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Slice remaining banana in half lengthwise; lay banana halves over the top, cut side up. Evenly sprinkle remaining 1 tablespoon brown sugar over the top.</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a wooden pick inserted in the center comes out with a few moist crumbs, 50 to 55 minutes. Let cool in pan on a wire rack for 15 minutes; using parchment paper overhang.</li>        
    </ol>
